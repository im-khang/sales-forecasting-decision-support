# Sales Forecasting Decision Support

Forecasting workflow for sales planning, model comparison, and decision-support reporting.

## Business question

What decision can this analysis or workflow support, and what evidence should a reviewer inspect first?

## Data source

Sample sales dataset already included in original repo; large/raw variants should stay local-only.

## Repository structure

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run / verify

1. `python scripts/verify.py`

## Public outputs

- Dashboard or BI artifact: `dashboard/`
- Findings and evidence notes: `reports/`
- Evaluation notes: `docs/`
- Supporting references: `references/`

## Data and security policy

- Credentials, environment files, local raw data, generated working data, databases, archives, and scratch outputs are ignored by `.gitignore`.
- Public repo keeps only shareable code, sample-safe artifacts, documentation, dashboard files, and evidence summaries.
- Claims should stay bounded by available data and documented assumptions.
